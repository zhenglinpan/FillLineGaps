A depthwise U-Net is trained on the line art dataset with simulation defect sythesizing approach. The model is able to fill gaps on lines and corners with a single forward pass. The model is trained on a RTX3060 GPU Laptop with 6GB memory. The training takes about 0.5 hours per 100 images in training set.

Inference time: ~2s for `1920Ã—1080` per image on RTX3060 GPU Laptop.

You can configure the `infer.py` to load the model and do your inference. You can download it from [here]().
Or you can also train your own model, use

```python
python codebase/lite_unet/lite_unet.py
```

To train your own model. The training data is not provided here since the copyright issues, you can use your own dataset to train the model.
